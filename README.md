# Hi, I'm Rowland 👋

I'm a passionate and pragmatic **Software Engineer** with 8+ years of professional experience building scalable, secure, and impactful software solutions across **three continents**. I bring a full-spectrum engineering mindset to solving problems — from frontend finesse to backend robustness and cloud-native architecture.

Currently based in **Kitchener, Ontario**. I love football (the global kind), traveling, and always learning.
